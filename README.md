## Introduction
In the digital age, efficient transaction processing is crucial for businesses and consumers. This project leverages machine learning to enhance the routing of credit card transactions, ensuring faster and more cost-effective payments.

## Data Overview
The dataset includes transaction details from various PSPs, including features such as transaction amount, country, PSP, and outcome. Data cleaning and preprocessing steps are applied to ensure quality inputs for the model.

## Methodology
The project employs a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques. Various models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, are evaluated to determine the best approach.

## Model Training and Evaluation
Detailed steps on how models are trained, evaluated, and selected based on performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are also discussed.

## Results
Summary of the model performance, including key metrics and visualizations. Insights gained from the predictive model and potential business impacts are highlighted.
